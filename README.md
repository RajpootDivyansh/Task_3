## 📌 SQL Tasks Performed

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ✅ Basic Filtering | Used SELECT and WHERE to filter by state |
| ✅ Sorting | Used ORDER BY to sort by zip code |
| ✅ Aggregation | Used GROUP BY with COUNT() to count customers by state |
| ✅ Subqueries | Filtered using zip code frequency with a subquery |
| ✅ Views | Created a view of frequently occurring zip codes |
| ✅ Limiting Results | Used LIMIT 10 in all queries to limit output rows for readability |
